            Hi Guys!!! I am a 3rd year student at Ptit. This site is for me to
            share my books, pod cards, and skin care tips. This is the website
            of a girl who studies IT but is not good at coding, so I hope
            everyone forgives my mistake if there are mistakes on this website.
          </p>
